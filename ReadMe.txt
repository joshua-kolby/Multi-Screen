DESCRIPTION..............................................................................................
Multi-Screen is a python based program that can open and close applications open on your computer.
This program simulates what a multi-monitor setup would act like, but for single monitor setups such as
laptops or single screen desktops.

HOW TO USE...............................................................................................
- When opening the exe the user is presented a simple application with a top menu and 4 screen buttons
- The program is set by default to begin on the first screen
- When the user clicks on a different screen button, all applications that are not minimized are saved
  on that screen, then minimized
- The next time that the user clicks on the previous screen, the applications will open back up to their
  previous position (the window does not have to be maximized
- The leftmost menu button drags the application to the mouse position on the screen (cannot leave the screen)
- The middle menu button will show and hide the screen buttons
- The rightmost button will exit the application
- There will be a video demo provided on the page where this can be downloaded from

ADDITIONAL NOTES.........................................................................................
- When two or more programs are open on top of each other and a different screen is selected, upon
  returning to that screen, the programs will "fight" each other to be on top. Only causes visual
  issues, no issues will happen within the program itself
- The program does not show in the task bar when opened, so having a shortcut on the desktop is the
  recommended way to access this application
- At this time (06/09/23), there are no issues within the program. If any issues happen in the future,
  they will likely be due to the python version being out of date. Hopefully that doesn't happen
- This program can only minimize and restore applications and has NO access to the content within the
  applications and does NOT have access to any information within your computer or the applications

I hope this program can simplify your workflow
